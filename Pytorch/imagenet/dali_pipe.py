    DALI Train Pipeline
    Based on the official example: https://github.com/NVIDIA/DALI/blob/master/docs/examples/pytorch/resnet50/main.py
    In comparison to the example, the CPU backend does more computation on CPU, reducing GPU load & memory use.
    This dataloader implements ImageNet style training preprocessing, namely:
    -random resized crop
    -random horizontal flip

    batch_size (int): how many samples per batch to load
    num_threads (int): how many DALI workers to use for data loading.
    device_id (int): GPU device ID
    data_dir (str): Directory to dataset.  Format should be the same as torchvision dataloader,
    containing train & val subdirectories, with image class subfolders
    crop (int): Image output size (typically 224 for ImageNet)
    mean (tuple): Image mean value for each channel
    std (tuple): Image standard deviation value for each channel
    local_rank (int, optional, default = 0) â€“ Id of the part to read
    world_size (int, optional, default = 1) - Partition the data into this many parts (used for multiGPU training)
    dali_cpu (bool, optional, default = False) - Use DALI CPU mode instead of GPU
    shuffle (bool, optional, default = True) - Shuffle the dataset each epoch
    fp16 (bool, optional, default = False) - Output the data in fp16 instead of fp32 (GPU mode only)
    min_crop_size (float, optional, default = 0.08) - Minimum random crop size
